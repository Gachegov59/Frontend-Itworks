Exercise 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations
Create a chain of promises to perform and log the result of three arithmetic operations in sequence. Start with a number, then add 5, multiply by 3, and finally subtract 2.

Exercise 2: String Manipulation
Write a promise chain that takes a string, converts it to uppercase, then reverses it, and finally appends the string "-finished" at the end. Log the final result.
Use `then` for every phase

Exercise 3: Array Filtering and Mapping
Write a function compareToNum that takes a number as an argument and returns a Promise
that tests if the value is less than or greater than the value 10 (reject otherwise)
compareToNum({num:10,isAboveNum:5}) //will reject
.then(result => console.log(result))
.catch(error => console.log(error))
compareToNum({num:10,isAboveNum:12}) //will resolve
.then(result => console.log(result))
.catch(error => console.log(error))

Exercise 4: Delayed Greetings
Simulate a delayed greeting with promises. First, wait 2 seconds, then log "Hello", wait another second, and log "World!". Each step should be done in a separate .then().

Exercise 5: Error Handling
Create a promise chain that attempts to parse JSON data. Use a try/catch block within a .then() method to handle JSON parsing errors. If successful, log the parsed object; if an error occurs, log "Invalid JSON".
Bonus
Make an async await version

Exercise 6: Promise all
Create "resolveImmediate" that resolves immediately to a number
Create "resolveDelayed" that resolves to a number after 2 seconds
function combine(prmX, prmY) {
  return Promise.all([prmX, prmY]).then((values) => {
  return values[0] + values[1];
  });
}
// `fetchX()` should return a promise that is resolved to 25 immediately
// and `fetchY()` should return a promise that is resolved after 2 seconds to 17
combine(resolveImmediate(), resolveDelayed())
.then((sum) => {
console.log(sum);
});
